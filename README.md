# Assignment 19: CryptoClustering

### Notice to Graders: 
Please note that I used ChatGPT to explain a couple of concepts that were a bit difficult to comprehend at first, namely the principle componant analysis.

## Background
In this challenge, I utilized my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Acknowledgments
The CryptoClustering Challenge was created as an assignment for the University of California, Irvine Data Analytics Bootcamp - June 2024 Cohort under the instruction and guidance of Melissa Engle (Instructor) and Mitchell Stone (TA).
The practical exercises and coding examples demonstrated through the bootcamp helped inform and inspire the code for this project.
